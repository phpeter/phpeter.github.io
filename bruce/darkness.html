<h1>And God Created <span class="dark">Darkness</span></h1>
<p>In the beginning, God created darkness.  After being told that “God created the heavens and the earth” in Genesis 1:1 we’re given a broad, step-by-step account of how creation took place.  Step one: “The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep.”  God could have spoken beauty and organization into existence in a moment; yet He spoke into existence a dark mess!  Why did He start with darkness and then form it into a beautiful, functional, inhabited creation?</p>
<p>I propose that it’s because “in the beginning” God was not only creating, He was teaching.  His actions tell us what kind of God He is.  On that first day, darkness and chaos didn’t last.  Instead, into that darkness, “God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light.”</p>
<p>These details, recorded about Day 1, not only describe creation, they give us a wonderful picture of redemption.  When Christ came, the apostle John described Him as the Creator. Then John uses the events of creation to help us understand the wonder of our redemption.</p>

<h2>John 1:1–5 (ESV)</h2>
<p>1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.</p>
<p>The God who created all things is the God who brings light out of darkness and life out of death.  This order of creation – first darkness, then light; first death, then life; first chaos, then order; first emptiness, then fullness – reveals the order and nature of redemption.    In creation, the Spirit moves over the chaos, God speaks, and light shines out of darkness and overcomes the darkness.  In redemption, the Spirit moves into the chaos and confusion of the sinner’s life, the Word of God comes into the person’s heart and mind, and the Father brings the light of truth that dispels the darkness of ignorance and sin.  Even before man sinned against God and plunged all of creation into its fallen state, God demonstrated through creation that He is able to save.</p>
<p>As we walk through the creation week, we see this redemptive hope building.  From day one, when God tells us of the passing of time, we read, “And there was evening and there was morning, the first day … the second day … the third day ....”  We normally think of a day as “morning and evening”; yet in the creation week, the reckoning is “evening and morning,”  first darkness; then light.  God is emphasizing the truth that darkness is not the end, it’s not the goal, it’s not the most powerful.  “For God, who said, ‘Let light shine out of darkness,’ has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.   2 Corinthians 4:6  Because God said that the day is evening and then morning, we live in anticipation!  And we are to continue to anticipate the coming of Christ “until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.”  2 Peter 1:19</p>
